- Path matching class (setActivePath()), with ability to supply custom matching class

- Allow an item to be made active, but not printed in the output (display/render/visible = false, hidden = true)
	- don't display children if no active children
	- add test to ensure hidden children urls are not included in getItemUrl

- config options
	- include children when inactive (find a better name?)
	- beforerender callback (check cake patterns)
	= LEVEL OVERRIDE FOR ALL OPTIONS AND TEMPLATES

- make siblingCount key available to template (siblingCount does not include hidden siblings)

- make class/className key available to template? 

- support arrays in url key

- setItems should automatically setActivePath (calling path matching class), with a param to prevent this behaviour
	- ensure a test exists that proves config() is required before setItems() in Menu constructor
